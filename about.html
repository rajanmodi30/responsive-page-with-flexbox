                                <span class="text-black">I used to be a pack rat. </span>I had
                                so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was
                                I couldn't even appreciate any of it because there was too
                                much.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I
                                didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                                <span class="text-black">I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
                                    everything.</span>
                                I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my
                                place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a
                                bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

                                Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better.
                                I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more
                                free time to enjoy.

                                and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well,
