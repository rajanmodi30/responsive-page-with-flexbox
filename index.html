                            <p> Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their
                                relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as
                                possible, it will help balance everything out. </p>

                            <p> A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't decorate, or
                                they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple
                                will help draw the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
